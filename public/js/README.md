[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/index.html) is the most advanced, responsive front-end framework in the world. The framework is mobile friendly and ready for you to customize it any way you want to use it.


In any industry or product, effective monitoring of key values or metrics is very important to provide quality service. In that process a huge set of data is used, most of time the data is not user friendly or easy to read/intepret. So the data is transformed to consumable display units like charts, tables, etc. Those display units are grouped together and put on a portal. Typically the portal need a dashboard based template instead of any simple template. A dashboard template give easy accessibility to various display units.


Foundation CSS helps to create responsive front-end. It is very effective. When I came across a scenario where I need to develop a UI for admin guys to view the metrics on a dashboard, I could not find any admin dashboard template based on Foundation. So came up with this template. This template is simple, responsive, easy accessible, and a very good starting point.
